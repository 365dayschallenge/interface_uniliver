    <h1 class="intro-title">DOVE</h1>
    <p>Dove started its life in 1957 in the US, with the revolutionary new beauty cleansing bar. With its patented blend of mild cleansers and ¼ moisturising cream, Dove’s iconic Beauty Bar rinses cleaner than soap, leaving skin clean, soft and smooth. It is the #1 dermatologist recommended brand in the US, Canada and France and strongly endorsed by dermatologists across the world.  

For over 17 years, Dove has been working to make beauty a source of confidence, not anxiety. Beauty is not defined by shape, size or colour – it’s authentic. Unique. Real. We invite all women to experience beauty on their own terms by engaging them with products that deliver superior care.

But Dove care goes beyond our products.

We care about all women, female-identifying and non-binary people. We want to redefine beauty standards and help everyone experience beauty and body image positively. We care about the future generation: helping girls build positive self-esteem through the Dove Self-Esteem Project, ensuring the world they enter is removed of toxic beauty standards. We care about how we make our products and what goes into them, about the impact we have on our planet and how we can strive for a better, more sustainable way of being.

Women have always been our inspiration. Since the beginning, we have been wholly committed to providing superior care to all women and to championing real women and real beauty in our advertising.
As part of the 2004 Dove Campaign for Real Beauty, we featured images of real women in our advertising that represented a broader image of beauty. Together with generations of women, Dove has helped widen the definition of beauty.
